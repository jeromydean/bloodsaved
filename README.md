BloodSaved (Bloodstained Save Editor) - A save game editor for Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.  


## ðŸ“– About 

BloodSaved is currently in an early status but it already has the ability to inject 100% of the items (books, keys, weapons, etc) and 100% of the shards (including skill shards).  Coming soon: a user interface written using Avalonia to allow for cross-platform use.

I have tested the saves produced by the application on PS4 and PC (GOG) versions of Bloodstained.
